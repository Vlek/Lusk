"""Main game event loop.

The game loop is the event loop that is able to take input from the
user, draw things on screen, perform game logic, and process any
network calls within a timeframe that will allow for there to be
no perceiveable lag.

This loop is templates off of the one given in an article written
about trying to create a better pygame event loop than the main
ones that are given. This is supposed to be able to better handle
events using async functionality as opposed to the ones that
throttle the CPU and cause tearing.
